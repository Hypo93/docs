# Configuration
:::note
This configuration guide describes both possible ways to create a working configuration file, with or without a configuration wizard.
The former is only possible for non-Docker-based systems.
:::


## Configuration with wizard

This part of the guide is aimed at users who use evcc as a Linux/Mac or Windows installation.

- You can now start the configuration wizard - simply follow the prompts in your terminal!

  ```sh
  evcc configure
  ```

  Once all devices are configured, you can continue on.

  :::note
  Advanced users (those with evcc experience & some technical know-how) might want to use the advanced configurator:

  ```sh
  evcc configure --advanced
  ```

  This mode offers some further, more technically-involved options.
  :::

- Test to make sure your new configuration works:

  ```sh
  evcc -c evcc.yaml
  ```

  Open a browser and head to `http://localhost:7070`: the evcc interface should now show your own devices.

- If everything's working, press `CTRL+C` to stop the server.

- Move the generated configuration to its home:

  ```sh
  sudo mv evcc.yaml /etc
  ```

- Start evcc:

  ```sh title="Linux"
  sudo systemctl start evcc
  ```

  ```sh title="MacOS"
  brew services start evcc
  ```

  Other possible commands are ... restart evcc and ... stop evcc.

- Go back to your browser and refresh to make sure everything's working as it should be!


## Configuration without wizard

:::note
This part of the guide is aimed at users who use evcc as a Home Assistant addon or as a Docker container and therefore cannot use the configuration wizard.
However, the guide may contain useful tips for people who still need to adjust their configuration after using the configuration wizard.
:::


In the following instruction it is assumed that you have created an empty configuration file _evcc.yaml_ in the correct directory.
The instructions can be found in the respective installation instructions for Docker or Home Assistant.

```sh
- config_file Docker:  `/etc/evcc.yaml`
- config_file Home Assistant: `/config/evcc.yaml`
```

Copy the content of the following minimal template into the _evcc.yaml_ file you just created.
The template creates a standard configuration with static demo entities.

```yaml title="evcc.yaml Mini Template"
## Configuration template with demo entities (meters, chargers) ##

# log settings

  site: debug
  lp-1: debug
  lp-2: debug

# meter definitions
# name can be freely chosen and is used as reference when assigning meters to site and loadpoints
# for documentation see https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/meters
meters:
  # replace with your real grid meter

      - my_pv
    battery:
      - my_battery

# define your loadpoints according your needs
# see https://docs.evcc.io/en/docs/reference/configuration/loadpoints
loadpoints:
  - title: Garage # display name for UI
    charger: my_charger # charger
    vehicle: my_car # default vehicle

# enter your real grid tariff and feed-in price
# see https://docs.evcc.io/docs/devices/tariffs
tariffs:
  currency: EUR
  grid:
    type: fixed
    price: 0.29 # EUR/kWh
  feedin:
    type: fixed
    price: 0.10 # EUR/kWh
```

If you want to see how evcc runs in a dynamic demo instead,
copy the content of https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/cmd/demo.yaml into your _evcc.yaml_ file.

- Now you can go ahead and start the addon or the Docker container.
- Check the installation by opening the WebUI - you should now see the evcc web interface in a static demo mode.
- If this is ok, you can edit the _evcc.yaml_ file and create your own setup (only possible with the static template).
- To do this, copy the necessary templates that you can find in the documentation in the section [Devices, e.g. wallboxes](../devices/chargers).

:::tip
If you cannot manage the manual configuration, you should install a stand-alone evcc Windows or Linux system and use the configuration wizard.

The configuration wizard is not available in the Home Assistant environment.

It is easier to use `evcc configure` there and then copy the generated _evcc.yaml_ to the desired system.

**Advanced users** (with evcc experience and some technical know-how) should use the advanced configurator:
:::

The minimal template contains only the most necessary sections of the configuration.

If you need structures or explanations that are not listed, it is worth taking a look at the fully developed template at this
link https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/evcc.dist.yaml.


- Test each newly added device to ensure that your new configuration works.
- Once all devices are configured, you can continue with the setup via the user interface.

:::tip
For Home Assistant users

Proceed with the installation of the evcc integration for Home Assistant as described in this section [Integrations](../integrations/home-assistant).
