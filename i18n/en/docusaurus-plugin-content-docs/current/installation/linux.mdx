# Linux (Debian, Raspberry Pi, ...)

This guide is aimed at apt-based Linux distributions like Debian, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi OS.
For other Linux distributions, see the [Docker](/installation/docker) or [Manual Installation](/installation/manual) guide.

## Installation Guide

- Open a terminal
- Install required dependencies:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
  ```

- Add the evcc APT repository:

<Tabs groupId="release-type">
  <TabItem value="Release" label="Release" default>
  Current stable release

```sh
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/stable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Nightly" label="Nightly">
  Development release. Updated daily. May be unstable.

```sh
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/unstable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Update the package list:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Install evcc:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y evcc
  ```

- Start the evcc server:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start evcc
  ```

- Now check the installation by opening a browser to `http://localhost:7070`. You should see the evcc web interface in demo mode.

- Stop the server:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop evcc
  ```

:::note
During installation, a user `evcc` is created, so ensure the logged-in user does not have the name `evcc`.
:::

## Configuration

A **working** evcc configuration is required.

### Create

We recommend using the configuration wizard:

- Start the configuration wizard and answer the questions:

```sh
sudo evcc configure
```

- Move the created configuration file to `/etc/evcc.yaml`:

```sh
sudo mv evcc.yaml /etc
```

- Restart the evcc server:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart evcc
```

- Access the evcc interface at [http://localhost:7070](http://localhost:7070)

### Modify

If your configuration needs adjustments, you can either rerun the configuration wizard (see above) or manually edit the configuration file.

- Edit the configuration file:

```sh
sudo nano /etc/evcc.yaml
```

- Restart the evcc server:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart evcc
```

For more information and examples on configuring evcc, see [Configuration](./configuration).

## Upgrades

To update to the latest version of evcc, follow this guide:

- Check the [releases](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases) for breaking changes (BC) for your installation
- Open a terminal
- Update the package list:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Upgrade evcc:

  ```sh
  sudo apt --only-upgrade install -y evcc
  ```

:::info
If the unstable repository (nightly versions) has been added, the update will always be updated to the latest available nightly version. If this is no longer desired, the unstable repository can be removed using `sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/evcc-unstable.list`.
:::

## Downgrade

If you need to go backwards for any reason, you can do so with this command:

```sh
  sudo apt install evcc=x.xxx.x # Version Number
```

## Managing the Service

evcc runs as a background system service. Here's some useful commands to control it:

```sh
sudo systemctl status evcc # shows status
sudo systemctl start evcc # start the service, if it isn't already running
sudo systemctl stop evcc # stops the service
sudo systemctl restart evcc # restart the service
sudo systemctl enable evcc # sets the service to run at boot
sudo systemctl disable evcc # stops the service running at boot
```

## Testing

Check the installation

- Show the running evcc service:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status evcc
  ```

- Check the latest log entries of the evcc service:

  ```sh
  sudo journalctl -u evcc --since "yesterday"
  ```

- Validate the meter configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug meter
  ```

- Validate the charger configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug charger
  ```

- Validate the vehicle configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug vehicle
  ```

Open a browser and enter the following URL: `http://127.0.0.1:7070`.

:::note
Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address or hostname of the computer if the browser is not opened on the same computer.
:::

## Backup and Restore

To restore the "original state" after a reinstallation, it is sufficient to back up the configuration file `evcc.yaml` and the database file `evcc.db`.
The storage location is specified in the log file at program start.
Typically, the configuration is located under `/etc/evcc.yaml` and the database under `/var/lib/evcc/evcc.db`.

Both files can be copied using the Linux command `cp`.

Example (copying from the usual storage location to the home directory):

Copy yaml: `sudo cp /etc/evcc.yaml /home/pi/evcc.yaml.bak`

Copy db: `sudo cp /var/lib/evcc/evcc.db /home/pi/evcc.db.bak`
