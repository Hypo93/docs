:::caution
This guide is aimed specifically at APT-based distributions. For distributions using other package managers, please install using [Docker](docker) or [Manual Installation](manual).

## Installation Guide

:::note
The "evcc" user is created during installation - please make sure this user doesn't already exist!
:::

- Open a terminal
- Install required dependencies:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
  ```

- Add the evcc APT repository:

<Tabs groupId="release-type">
  <TabItem value="Release" label="Release" default>
  Current stable release

```sh
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/stable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Nightly" label="Nightly">
  Development release. Updated daily. May be unstable.

```sh
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.evcc.io/public/evcc/unstable/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

- Update the package list:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Install evcc:

  ```sh
  sudo apt install -y evcc
  ```

- Start the evcc server:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start evcc
  ```

- Now check the installation by opening a browser to `http://localhost:7070`. You should see the evcc web interface in demo mode.

- Stop the server:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl stop evcc
  ```

## Configuration

A **working** evcc configuration is required.

Follow the [instructions](./configuration#configuration-with-wizard) to create a configuration file with the configuration wizard.


## Upgrades

To update to the latest version of evcc, follow this guide:

- Check the [releases](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases) for breaking changes (BC) for your installation
- Open a terminal
- Update the package list:

  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```

- Upgrade evcc:

  ```sh
  sudo apt --only-upgrade install -y evcc
  ```

:::info
If the unstable repository (nightly versions) has been added, the update will always be updated to the latest available nightly version. If this is no longer desired, the unstable repository can be removed using `sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/evcc-unstable.list`.
:::

## Downgrade

If you need to go backwards for any reason, you can do so with this command:

```sh
  sudo apt install evcc=x.xxx.x # Version Number
```

## Managing the Service

evcc runs as a background system service. Here's some useful commands to control it:

```sh
sudo systemctl status evcc # shows status
sudo systemctl start evcc # start the service, if it isn't already running
sudo systemctl stop evcc # stops the service
sudo systemctl restart evcc # restart the service
sudo systemctl enable evcc # sets the service to run at boot
sudo systemctl disable evcc # stops the service running at boot
```

## Useful Commands

- Show the service status:

  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status evcc
  ```

- Show all log entries since yesterday:

  ```sh
  sudo journalctl -u evcc --since "yesterday"
  ```

- Validate the meter configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug meter
  ```

- Validate the charger configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug charger
  ```

- Validate the vehicle configuration:

  ```sh
  sudo evcc -l debug vehicle
  ```
