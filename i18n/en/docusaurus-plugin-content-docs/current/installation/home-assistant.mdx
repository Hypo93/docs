# Home Assistant Addon

:::note
The evcc Home Assistant addon is a community integration and is not ‘yet’ officially supported by the evcc maintainers.
The reason for this is that important data cannot simply be made available in the event of an error (missing evcc cli).
:::

These instructions are aimed at users who use Home Assistant and want to use evcc as an add-on. It is of course also possible
to run evcc outside of Home Assistant and to integrate it into Home Assistant. Operating evcc as an add-on is of course
the easier way, but has the disadvantage that you cannot use the configuration assistant.

Note: The addon requires very few resources.

## Installation Guide

1. Click -> Add-on Store under Settings - Addons.
2. Click -> three dots -> Repositories.
3. Copy https://github.com/evcc-io/hassio-addon Click -> Add
4. Reload the WebSite (CTRL+R or CTRL+F5 or CTRL+Fn+F5)
5. Find the "evcc" add-on and click it.
6. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

### Configuration

Go to Information menu in the "evcc" Addon and activate "show in side bar" (evcc UI http://your-ha-instance-ip-address:7070)
