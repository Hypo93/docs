# Home Assistant Addon

:::important
The evcc Home Assistant addon is a community integration and is not officially supported by the evcc maintainers.
The reason for this is that important data cannot simply be made available in the event of an error (missing `evcc cli`).
:::

This guide describes the installation of evcc as a Home Assistant addon.
Unlike the [Linux installation](./linux) or [Docker installation](./docker), you don't need command line knowledge here.

## Prerequisites

You need a Home Assistant installation with the Addon Store enabled.
Depending on your installation type, this feature might not be available.
See [Home Assistant Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/#advanced-installation-methods) for more information.

## Installation

1. Click on **Settings** → **Addons** → **Add-on Store**
2. Click on the **three dots** → **Repositories**
3. Add the repository URL and click **Add**
    ```
    https://github.com/evcc-io/hassio-addon
    ```
4. Reload the webpage
5. Find the **evcc** addon and click on it
6. Click on the **INSTALL** button

## Configuration File

Go to Information menu in the "evcc" Addon and activate "show in side bar" (evcc UI http://your-ha-instance-ip-address:7070)

Go to Configuration menu and select your working directory (example):

```sh
- config_file: /config/evcc.yaml
- sqlite_file: /data/evcc.db
```

Leave the Network section unchanged.

Create an evcc configuration file `evcc.yaml` in your Home Assistant root configuration folder (`/homeassistant`).
Under [Configuration](./configuration) you'll find instructions on how to create this.

## Updates

The update to the latest version of evcc is integrated into the Home Assistant update process.

## Next Step: Integration

Once your system is running, you can set up the integration between evcc and Home Assistant.
Under [Integrations → Home Assistant](../integrations/home-assistant) you'll find more information.
You can visualize evcc data in Home Assistant or create automations based on evcc.
