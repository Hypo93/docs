# Home Assistant

Learn how to visualize evcc data in Home Assistant and create automations.

This guide assumes that you have already installed evcc and Home Assistant.
If you are looking for installation instructions, you can find them under [Installation â†’ Home Assistant Addon](../installation/home-assistant).

## APIs

If you want to integrate devices such as chargers, meters, or vehicles into evcc that come from devices that evcc doesn't
support (e.g., Zigbee smart plugs), you can do this via [MQTT](./mqtt-api) or the [REST API](./rest-api).

Thanks to these two evcc APIs, additional charging points can be implemented for a variety of deferrable loads (consumers),
such as heating devices, washing machines, dishwashers, or electric scooters.

## Option 1: ha-evcc Integration

With the [ha-evcc](https://github.com/marq24/ha-evcc) integration by [marq24](https://github.com/marq24), you can easily integrate evcc data and functions into Home Assistant.
This works regardless of whether you run evcc in Home Assistant or not.

The integration supports all necessary entities provided by evcc via API, including those for customizing
evcc settings, charging points, and the corresponding vehicles.

After installation, you'll get a long list of all entities that you can use in Home Assistant.

## Option 2: Manual MQTT Integration

MQTT is a simple communication protocol developed for the Internet of Things (IoT).
The MQTT approach is somewhat easier than using the REST API, but if you've never worked with MQTT before,
there are a few points to consider.

### Preparation

You need an MQTT broker.
This is a central node that mediates messages between different clients.
A very popular and simple broker is [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).
This can also be installed as a Home Assistant addon (see [guide (German)](https://alkly.de/mqtt-mit-home-assistant-fuer-anfaenger)).

Once you have installed a broker, you can use a tool like [MQTT Explorer](http://mqtt-explorer.com) to view and track messages on the broker.

### evcc MQTT Configuration

Next, we need to tell evcc to send its data to this broker.
To do this, the corresponding credentials must be added to the `evcc.yaml` file.

```yaml title="evcc.yaml"
mqtt:
  broker: <broker-ip>:1883
  topic: evcc # root topic for publishing, set empty to disable
  user: mosquitto
  password: yourpassword
```

After restarting evcc, you should be able to see the provided evcc topics in MQTT Explorer.

Now we can integrate this data into Home Assistant.

### Home Assistant MQTT Configuration

You can find a good guide on how to set up MQTT in Home Assistant in the [Blog Article by Alkly (German)](https://alkly.de/mqtt-mit-home-assistant-fuer-anfaenger).
It also includes examples of how to create a Home Assistant entity from certain measurements (e.g., charging power).

## Option 3: Manual REST Integration

You can also integrate evcc data into Home Assistant via the REST API.
You can find the available endpoints under [REST API](/docs/integrations/rest-api).

[This guide](https://github.com/marq24/ha-evcc/blob/main/HA_AS_EVCC_SOURCE.md) by [marq24](https://github.com/marq24) gives you detailed information on how to do this.
