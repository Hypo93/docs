# Windows

Here you'll find instructions for manually installing evcc on Windows.

:::important
This manual installation requires advanced PC knowledge, especially when working with the Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Running evcc on Windows is possible.
However, evcc is typically used in a Linux environment (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
:::

## Installation

- Download the appropriate file for your system
  - 64-Bit Intel CPU: [evcc_X.XX_windows_amd64.zip](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/releases/latest)
- Extract the downloaded file (e.g., by double-clicking)
- You'll now have a new folder containing the `evcc` program
- Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder containing the `evcc` program
- Start evcc with the following command:
  ```sh
  evcc -v
  ```
- You should see the current version of evcc (e.g., `evcc version 0.xxx.y`).

## Configuration

Create a working `evcc.yaml` configuration file following the instructions under [Configuration](./configuration).
You can start it with the following command:

```sh
./evcc -c evcc.yaml
```

## Update/Downgrade

Follow the steps above and replace the evcc program file with the new or previous version.
The configuration does not need to be redone.

## Background Service

:::note
This documentation assumes that evcc is located in `c:\evcc`.

These instructions were created using Windows 10.
:::

- Type "Task Scheduler" in the Windows 10 search bar.
- After typing just a few letters, it should appear as the top match and can be started with "Run as administrator" on the right side:

- In Task Scheduler, you can create the new service either in your own folder or in the general tasks folder.
  In this example, we'll create an `evcc` folder.
  Select "New Folder..." from the right-hand pane:

- Select the new `evcc` folder, open the context menu, and choose "Create Task":

- Enter a name (e.g., "evcc") and a brief description.
  Since this needs to run as a system service, click "Change User or Group" and enter "SYSTEM".
  After clicking "Check Names", the word "SYSTEM" should be underlined.
  Click OK to close this dialog:

- On the "Triggers" tab, click "New" and set "Begin the task" to "At startup".
  Click OK to close this dialog:

![Windows 10 Task Scheduler](win10-srv/win10-srv-5.png)

- On the "Actions" tab, click "New" and enter the following:
  - Program/script: `c:\evcc\evcc.exe`
  - Add arguments: `-c c:\evcc\evcc.yaml`

![Windows 10 Task Scheduler](win10-srv/win10-srv-6.png)

- On the "Settings" tab, check "Allow task to be run on demand" and "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed":

- You're done! ðŸŽ‰

You can now start the task manually or test it by rebooting.
To verify it's working correctly, open your browser and navigate to the evcc interface at `http://<evcc-ip>:7070`.
